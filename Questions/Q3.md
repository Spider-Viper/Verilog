1. What is a defparam used for?

2. What is $time in Verilog?
> $time is a system task that returns the current simulation time in simulation cycles or time units. It returns a 64-bit unsigned integer value.
>
> The value returned by $time is calculated based on the \`timescale directive. The \`timescale directive specifies the simulation time specifies the simulation time units and time precision used during simulation.
3. What does a wire refer to?
> a wire is a type of net data type that represents a physical connection between two or more logic gates and can only be driven by a module's output. It is called a "wire" because it behaves like a real-world electrical wire, allowing signals to flow from one point ot another.
4. What does a reg refer to?
5. What are blocking and non-blocking statements?
> blocking assignments execute sequentially, one after another. The next statement will not start until the current blocking assignment is completed. The value of the right-hand side expression is immediately computed and assigned to the left-hand side variable.
>
> non-blocking assignments appear to execute simultaneously, without waiting for the previous non-blocking assignment to complete. The right-hand side expression is scheduled for execution but the actual assignment to the left-hand side variable is delayed until the end of the time step or clock cycle.
