1. What do you understand by continuous assignment?
	* A continuous assignment statement allows the designer to assign a value to a signal or a wire continuously as long as the input changes. Unlike procedural assignments, which assign values to signals triggered by an event or a condition, continuous assignments are always active and assign values to signals based on their inputs.

	A continuous assignment statement is represented by the keyword *assign* followd by the expression that describes the signal. A continuous assignment is typically used with combinational logic circuit where the output depends solely on the input.

	assign关键字引导的赋值语句，被赋值的变量必须为wire类型。

2. What is the difference between $setup and $hold?
	* $setup and $hold are timing checks used in Verilog to ensure that the input signals are stable at the input of the flip-flop during the setup and hold time windows of the flip-flop.
	* $setup ia a timing check used to ensure that the input signal to a flip-flop changes sufficiently ahead of the clock rising edge so that the signal can settle stable by the time the clock edge arrives. $setup specifies the minimum time required for the input signal to reach a stable value before the active edge of the clock. Violation of the setup time can cause a race condition, metastability, and unpredictable behavior of the flip-flop.
	* $hold is a timing check used to ensure that the input signal to a flip-flop does not change while the clock is active and the input is being sampled by the flip-flop. $hold specifies the minimum time that the input signal should be held stable after the active edge of the clock. Violation of the hold time can cause a data loss, timing violations, and unpredictable behavior of the flip-flop.

3. Generate a sine wave using the Verilog coding style.(待解决)
``` systemverilog
module sine_wave_generator(
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    output logic signed [15:0] sine
);
    // lookup table containing 256 precomputed sine values
    logic signed [15:0] sin_table [0:255];
    // initialize the lookup table with sine values
    initial begin
        integer i;
        for (i = 0; i < 256; i++) begin
            sin_table[i] = $signed(32767 * $sin(2 * $pi * i / 256));
        end
    end
    // sine wave generation
    logic [15:0] index;
    logic [7:0] phase_acc;
    logic [7:0] phase_inc = (440 / 8000) * 256;
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            index <= 0;
            phase_acc <= 0;
        end else if (phase_acc >= 255) begin
            phase_acc <= 0;
            index <= index + 1;
        end else begin
            phase_acc <= phase_acc + phase_inc;
        end
        // output the sine value from the lookup table
        sine <= sin_table[index[7:0]];
    end
endmodule
```
4. What do you understand by casex and casez statements in Verilog?

5. What is verilog $random?(伪随机数？)
> $random system task generates a random value. It is used to simulate unpredictable values in a Verilog testbench. Use the $random task to generate a random value for a signal every time the  module is executed, thereby  ensuring that the design is tested with different scenarios.
> 
> $random system task returns a 32-bit signed integer. The range of values that the $random task can generate is dependent on the simulator and the seed value used. The seed value is an initial value that is used by the random number generator to produce the sequence of random numbers.
6. What are parallel threads in Verilog?
> initial block; always block; fork-join
